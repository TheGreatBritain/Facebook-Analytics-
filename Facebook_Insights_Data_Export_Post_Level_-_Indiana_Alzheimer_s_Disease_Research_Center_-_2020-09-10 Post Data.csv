Mollie recently shared:

 “Covid-19 requires multiple changes to daily life.  One of the primary changes for me was staying busy.  My volunteer, opportunities for Community Hospital, the Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter and Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center closed or transitioned.  How was I going to keep occupied? I was a part of a group email asking for volunteers to sew DYI facemasks for one of the hospitals.  My sewing machine had been “in mothballs” for about 10 years.  I was able to get it working with a goal of making 50 facemasks. As of today, I have produced and donated over 150 facemasks  with a goal of making 200.”

September's focus will be Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). FTD is an umbrella term used to describe a group of uncommon brain disorders characterized by atrophy, or shrinking, of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. 

FTD is often misdiagnosed as psychiatric problems due to the way it can impact behavior and personality. It is also often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's Disease due to the language and memory changes it may cause.
